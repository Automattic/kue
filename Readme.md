## Creating Jobs

 First create a job `Queue` with `kue.createQueue()`:

```js
var kue = require('kue')
  , jobs = kue.createQueue();
```

  Calling `jobs.create()` with the type of job ("email"), and arbitrary job data will return a `Job`, which can then be `save()`ed, adding it to redis, with a default priority level of "normal". The `save()` method optionally accepts a callback, responding with an `error` if something goes wrong. The `title` key is special-cased, and will display in the job listings within the UI, making it easier to find a specific job.

```js
jobs.create('email', {
    title: 'welcome email for tj'
  , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
  , template: 'welcome-email'
}).save();
```

### Job Priority

 To specify the priority of a job, simply invoke the `priority()` method with a number, or priority name, which is mapped to a number.

```js
jobs.create('email', {
    title: 'welcome email for tj'
  , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
  , template: 'welcome-email'
}).priority('high').save();
```

  The default priority map is as follows:

```js
{
    low: 10
  , normal: 0
  , medium: -5
  , high: -10
  , critical: -15
};
```

### Failure Attempts

 By default jobs only have _one_ attempt, that is when they fail, they are marked as a failure, and remain that way until you intervene. However, Kue allows you to specify this, which is important for jobs such as transferring an email, which upon failure, may usually retry without issue. To do this invoke the `.attempts()` method with a number.

 ```js
 jobs.create('email', {
     title: 'welcome email for tj'
   , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
   , template: 'welcome-email'
 }).priority('high').attempts(5).save();
```

### Job Logs

 Job-specific logs enable you to expose information to the UI at any point in the job's life-time. To do so simply invoke `job.log()`, which accepts a message string as well as variable-arguments for sprintf-like support:

```js 
job.log('$%d sent to %s', amount, user.name);
``` 

### Job Progress

 Job progress is extremely useful for long-running jobs such as video conversion. To update the job's progress simply invoke `job.progress(completed, total)`:

```js
job.progress(frames, totalFrames);
```

### Job Events

 Job-specific events are fired are fire on the `Job` instances themselves
 via Redis pubsub. The following events are currently supported:

    - `failed` the job has failed
    - `complete` the job has completed
    - `promotion` the job (when delayed) is now queued
    - `progress` the job's progress ranging from 0-100

 For example this may look something like the following:

```js
var job = jobs.create('video conversion', {
    title: 'converting loki\'s to avi'
  , user: 1
  , frames: 200
});

job.on('complete', function(){
  console.log("Job complete");
}).on('failed', function(){
  console.log("Job failed");
}).on('progress', function(progress){
  process.stdout.write('\r  job #' + job.id + ' ' + progress + '% complete');
});
```

### Delayed Jobs

  Delayed jobs may be scheduled to be queued for an arbitrary distance in tim by invoking the `.delay(ms)` method, passing the number of milliseconds relative to _now_. This automatically flags the `Job` as "delayed". 

```js
var email = jobs.create('email', {
    title: 'Account renewal required'
  , to: 'tj@learnboost.com'
  , template: 'renewal-email'
}).delay(minute)
  .priority('high')
  .save();
```

When using delayed jobs, we must also check the delayed jobs with a timer, promoting them if the scheduled delay has been exceeded. This `setInterval` is defined within `Queue#promote(ms)`, defaulting to a check every 5 seconds.

```js
jobs.promote();
```

## Processing Jobs

 Processing jobs is simple with Kue. First create a `Queue` instance much like we do for creating jobs, providing us access to redis etc, then invoke `jobs.process()` with the associated type.

 In the following example we pass the callback `done` to `email`, if this function responds with an error it will be displayed in the UI and the job will be marked as a failure.

```js
var kue = require('kue')
 , jobs = kue.createQueue();

jobs.process('email', function(job, done){
  email(job.to, done);
});
```

### Processing Concurrency

 By default a call to `jobs.process()` will only accept one job at a time for processing. For small tasks like sending emails this is not ideal, so we may specify the maximum active jobs for this type by passing a number:
 
```js
jobs.process('email', 20, function(job, done){
  // ...
});
```

### Updating Progress

 For a "real" example, let's say we need to compile a PDF from numerous slides with [node-canvas](http://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas). Our job may consist of the following data, note that in general you should _not_ store large data in the job it-self, it's better to store references like ids, pulling them in while processing.
 
```js
jobs.create('slideshow pdf', {
    title: user.name + "'s slideshow"
  , slides: [...] // keys to data stored in redis, mongodb, or some other store
});
```

  We can access this same arbitrary data within a separate process while processing, via the `job.data` property. In the example we render each slide one-by-one, updating the job's log and process. When an error occurs we invoke `done(err)` to tell Kue something happened, otherwise we invoke `done()` only when the job is complete.

```js
jobs.process('slideshow pdf', 5, function(job, done){
  var slides = job.data.slides
    , len = slides.length;

  function next(i) {
    var slide = slides[i]; // pretend we did a query on this slide id ;)
    job.log('rendering %dx%d slide', slide.width, slide.height);
    renderSlide(slide, function(err){
      if (err) return done(err);
      job.progress(i, len);
      if (i == len) done()
      else next(i + 1);
    });
  }

  next(0);
});
```

## Redis Connection Settings

  By default, Kue will connect to Redis using the client default settings (port defaults to `6389`, host defaults to `127.0.0.1`).  Redis client connection settings can be set by overriding the `kue.redis.createConnection` function.

  For example, to create a Redis client that connects to `192.168.1.2` on port `1234` that requires authentication, use the following:

  ```javascript
  var kue = require('kue')
    , redis = require('redis');
  
  kue.redis.createClient = function() {
      var client = redis.createClient(1234, '192.168.1.2');
      client.auth('YOUR_PASSWORD');
      return client;
  }
  ```

  Redis connection settings must be set before calling `kue.createQueue()` or accessing `kue.app`.

## User-Interface

 The UI is a small [Express](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) application, to fire it up simply run the following, altering the port etc as desired.

```js
var kue = require('kue');
kue.app.listen(3000);
```

The title defaults to "Kue", to alter this invoke:

```js
kue.app.set('title', 'My Application');
```

## JSON API

  Along with the UI Kue also exposes a JSON API, which is utilized by the UI.

### GET /stats

  Currently responds with state counts:

```js
{"inactiveCount":4,"completeCount":69,"activeCount":2,"failedCount":0}
```

### GET /job/:id

  Get a job by `:id`:

```js
{"id":"3","type":"email","data":{"title":"welcome email for tj","to":"tj@learnboost.com","template":"welcome-email"},"priority":-10,"progress":"100","state":"complete","attempts":null,"created_at":"1309973155248","updated_at":"1309973155248","duration":"15002"}
```

### GET /job/:id/log

  Get job `:id`'s log:
  
```js
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
```

### GET /jobs/:from..:to/:order?

  Get jobs with the specified range `:from` to `:to`, for
  example "/jobs/0..2", where `:order` may be "asc" or "desc":

```js
[{"id":"12","type":"email","data":{"title":"welcome email for tj","to":"tj@learnboost.com","template":"welcome-email"},"priority":-10,"progress":0,"state":"active","attempts":null,"created_at":"1309973299293","updated_at":"1309973299293"},{"id":"130","type":"email","data":{"title":"welcome email for tj","to":"tj@learnboost.com","template":"welcome-email"},"priority":-10,"progress":0,"state":"active","attempts":null,"created_at":"1309975157291","updated_at":"1309975157291"}]
```

### GET /jobs/:state/:from..:to/:order?

  Same as above, restricting by `:state` which is one of:
  
    - active
    - inactive
    - failed
    - complete

### GET /jobs/:type/:state/:from..:to/:order?

  Same as above, however restricted to `:type` and `:state`.

### DELETE /job/:id

  Delete job `:id`:
  
    $ curl -X DELETE http://local:3000/job/2
    {"message":"job 2 removed"}

## Parallel Processing With Cluster

 The example below shows how you may use [Cluster](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster) to spread the job processing load across CPUs. By default cluster will create one worker per CPU, however you can specify this number via `.set('workers', N)`.
 
 When cluster `.isMaster` the file is being executed in context of the master process, in which case you may perform tasks that you only want once, such as starting the web app bundled with Kue. The logic in the `else` block is executed _per worker_. 

```js
var kue = require('kue')
  , cluster = require('cluster')
  , jobs = kue.createQueue();

cluster = cluster()
  .set('workers', 8)
  .use(cluster.debug())
  .start();

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  kue.app.listen(3000);
} else {
  jobs.process('email', function(job, done){
    var pending = 5
      , total = pending;

    setInterval(function(){
      job.log('sending!');
      job.progress(total - pending, total);
      --pending || done();
    }, 1000);
  });
}
```

running this example you'll see the following output:

    $ node kue-example
    info - master started
    info - worker 0 spawned
    info - worker 1 spawned
    info - worker 2 spawned
    info - listening for connections
    info - worker 2 connected
    info - worker 1 connected
    info - worker 0 connected

now when you visit Kue's UI in the browser you'll see that jobs are being processed roughly 8 times faster! (if you have 8 cores).

## Securing Kue

 Through the use of app mounting you may customize the web application, enabling TLS, or adding additional middleware like Connect's `basicAuth()`.

```js
var app = express.createServer({ ... tls options ... });
app.use(express.basicAuth('foo', 'bar'));
app.use(kue.app);
app.listen(3000);
```
